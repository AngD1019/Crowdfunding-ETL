# Crowdfunding-ETL

## Project Overview
Using the analysis performed with the Crowdfunding ETL project and SQL data analysis, the purpose of this project is to perform both an ETL process and a data analysis by using SQL queries on a new dataset. This new dataset hold information showing the backers who have pledged to the live projects.

Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks were used to extract and transform the backers’ contact information from a CSV file to create a DataFrame that will be exported as a CSV file. In the load phase, the dataset was used to create an ERD and a table schema to create a new table in the crowdfunding_db database. The CSV file that contains the backers’ information into this table was uploaded into this table. And finally, data analysis was performed on the crowdfunding_db database by using SQL queries.

The steps of this project include:
1. Extract Data
2. Transform and Clean Data
3. Create an ERD and Table Schema, and Load Data
4. SQL Analysis
